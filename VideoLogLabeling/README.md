# VideoLogLabeling
A tool for labeling event logs synchronized with videos.

This project is mainly configured by a configuration file `config`.
To adjust the default configuration, you can simply execute the following command:

```php index.php dumpconfig > config```

This creates a configuration file with the default values and you adjust them for your own needs.


Example of usage to label kick events in RoboCup games:
